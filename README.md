##Predicting 30-Day Readmissions for OSF Health**

As part of the OSF 30-Day Readmission competition, organized by Illinois State University and OSF Health, I developed a high-performing binary classification model using XGBoost to predict whether a patient discharged from OSF Health would be readmitted within 30 days. The primary objective of this competition was to assist healthcare providers in preventing avoidable readmissions, which are linked to negative health outcomes and strained hospital resources. By accurately predicting readmissions, hospitals can optimize bed capacity and improve overall patient care.

### Objective and Motivation
Readmissions are a significant concern in healthcare, as they often indicate unresolved issues during the initial admission, posing additional health risks to patients. Reducing avoidable readmissions not only benefits patients but also alleviates the pressure on hospital systems by allowing better allocation of resources. For the competition, participants were tasked with building models based solely on information available to clinicians at the time of discharge. This makes the challenge even more critical, as real-time predictions can inform post-discharge care strategies.

### Model Development
I chose to implement an XGBoost model due to its reputation for high performance in classification problems, especially in healthcare-related predictions. XGBoost’s ability to handle missing values, its regularization techniques to reduce overfitting, and its speed in training large datasets made it an ideal choice for this task.

The dataset included demographic information, clinical measurements, and other key patient characteristics at discharge. I meticulously pre-processed the data to handle missing values, scale features, and engineer meaningful variables that would enhance the model's predictive power. For example, I incorporated features such as the number of previous hospital visits, comorbidities, and length of stay, which I hypothesized would be highly predictive of readmission risk.

### Key Challenges
One of the major challenges I faced was dealing with class imbalance, as the number of patients readmitted was significantly lower than those not readmitted. To address this, I used techniques like oversampling the minority class and adjusted the model’s objective function to account for this imbalance, ensuring that the model didn't favor the majority class and could accurately predict readmissions.

Another hurdle was feature selection. Given the extensive amount of data available, careful feature engineering was crucial. I performed correlation analysis and used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to identify the most influential variables contributing to the model's predictions. This step was vital in ensuring the model remained interpretable, which is critical in a clinical setting where clinicians need to understand why the model is making certain predictions.

### Performance and Evaluation
The competition used the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as the evaluation metric, which measures the model’s ability to distinguish between patients who would be readmitted and those who wouldn’t. My XGBoost model achieved excellent performance, ranking second on the public leaderboard and fourth on the private leaderboard, with a consistently high AUC score across both datasets. This ranking demonstrates the model's strong generalization capabilities.

The submission required participants to predict the probability of readmission for each patient ID in the test set, which was evaluated against the true outcomes to generate the AUC score.

### Impact and Selection
At the conclusion of the competition, my model was selected as one of the top five to be presented to OSF Health Hospital. This selection highlights the model’s potential for real-world application in predicting readmissions and helping OSF Health optimize patient care management. The model's accurate and timely predictions could assist clinicians in identifying high-risk patients, enabling early interventions, personalized follow-up plans, and ultimately reducing the strain on hospital resources.

Being chosen among the top five models for OSF Health reinforces the clinical value of data-driven approaches in improving healthcare delivery. It also marks a significant milestone in my journey as a data scientist, furthering my expertise in predictive modeling and its critical role in healthcare systems.
